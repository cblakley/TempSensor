## Introduction

The TempSensor i2c device is a fully enclosed temperature and humdity sensor. The  The TempSensor is built on the Broadcom develompent platfrom, using a Raspberry Pi 3B+. The device reads in temperature and humidity data and using a python script it displays the infromation to the user. 

## TempSensor Specifications and Parts

In order the build the TempSensor a couple of things are needed first. A full list of parts is avilable [here](https://github.com/cblakley/TempSensor/blob/master/Documentation/CENG319Budget.xlsx?raw=true).

Most importantly the Raspberry Pi. If one is not avalible I'd recommend the Canakit starter kit which is avalible [here](https://www.amazon.ca/CanaKit-Raspberry-Starter-Premium-Black/dp/B07BCC8PK7/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1543943043&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=raspberry+pi+3+b%2B&psc=1) from Amazon Canda.

The AM2315 Sensor itself avalible [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1293) from Adafruit.
